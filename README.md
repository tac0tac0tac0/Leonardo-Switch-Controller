# Leonardo-Switch-Controller
![image of box](/images/%2BIMG_8785.JPG)  
This is my rendition of a rectangle controller, based on the work of Crane1195 (https://github.com/Crane1195/).  
It utilises a Fork Mheironimus Arduino Joystick library by Jas2o (https://github.com/Jas2o/Leonardo-Switch-Controller).  
  This Code features a Dpad/Analog Stick Toggle (Press MOD and HOME and the same time), as well as an on the fly programmable Button,
  (Press Mod + the button you want it to be. Only works with A,B,X,Y,L,R,ZL and ZR).
